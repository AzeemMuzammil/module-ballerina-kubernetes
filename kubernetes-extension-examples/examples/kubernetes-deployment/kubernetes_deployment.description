//Ballerina supports generating Kubernetes artifacts based on annotations.
//A single Ballerina module is mapped to a single Kubernetes deployment.
//Minikube or Docker for Mac/Windows should be configured and
//Kubernetes should be enabled to run the example.
//This example deploys an HTTPS service, which retrieves values from a config file to Kubernetes.
//Before running the sample, copy the ballerinaKeystore.p12 and ballerinaTruststore.p12 files
//located in https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/tree/master/examples/resources/
//to the current working directory, from where the ballerina build command will be issued.
