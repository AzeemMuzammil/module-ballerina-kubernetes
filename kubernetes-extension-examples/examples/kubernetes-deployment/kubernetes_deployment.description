//Ballerina supports generating Kubernetes artifacts based on annotations.
//A single Ballerina module is mapped to a single Kubernetes deployment.
//Minikube or Docker for Mac/Windows should be configured and
//Kubernetes should be enabled to run the example.
//This example deploys an HTTPS service, which retrieves values from a config file to Kubernetes.
