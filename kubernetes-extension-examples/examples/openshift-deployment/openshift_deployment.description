//Ballerina supports generating OpenShift Route, BuildConfig and ImageStream artifacts based on annotations.
//Docker image of the ballerina service is built using the BuildConfig which then can be used by the generated Kubernetes Deployment.
//A generated OpenShift Route exposes the Kubernetes Service of the Ballerina Service.
//This example deploys http service which responses "Hello" followed by a name.
