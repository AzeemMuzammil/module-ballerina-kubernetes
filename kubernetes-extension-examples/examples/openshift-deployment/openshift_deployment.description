//Ballerina supports generating the OpenShift Route, BuildConfig, and ImageStream artifacts based on annotations.
//Docker image of the Ballerina service is built using the BuildConfig, which then can be used by the generated Kubernetes Deployment.
//A generated OpenShift Route exposes the Kubernetes Service of the Ballerina Service.
//This example deploys an HTTP service, which responses "Hello" followed by a name.<br/><br/>
